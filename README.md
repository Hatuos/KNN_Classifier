# KNN_Classifier
Hello, here you will find a basic design of a case study classifier. In this case a specific classifier has been implemented under the KNN algorithm.

## Description of the scenario
Develop in Java, using the object-oriented paradigm, a preliminary software system for the classification of instances using the k-nn method.

A dataset is available with a set of cases already classified and stored in a file. This set is called the training set. Each row of the training set has the same number of attributes and corresponds to an instance or case. The attributes describe the instance and each instance belongs to only one class. For this practice we will use a single class attribute which, for simplicity, we will consider it to be the last one of each instance.The rest of the instance attributes will be used to predict the class of future instances and are all of numeric type.
